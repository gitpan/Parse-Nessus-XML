NAME
    Parse::Nessus::XML - Interface to Nessus XML reuslt files

SYNOPSIS
      use Parse::Nessus::XML
      my $scan = Parse::Nessus::XML->new( $filename );
      my @results = $scan->results;

      my $plugin  = $scan->plugin(10964); # Parse::Nessus::XML::Plugin object
      my $name    = $plugin->name;

DESCRIPTION
    Provides an interface to the Nessus XML report file. This is primarily
    for my own use, so if it's missing stuff that you think should be in
    here, send me a patch.

    Please note that this API is just a suggestion, and is subject to change
    in the first few releases.

  new
      my $scan = Parse::Nessus::XML->new( $filename );

    Given the path to a file, returns a Parse::Nessus::XML object.

  results
        my $results = $scan->results; # listref
        my @results = $scan->results; # list

  plugin
    Returns a plugin object, given the ID. Then you can call for attributes
    off of that object.

      my $plugin = $scan->plugin(10964);
      $name = $plugin->name;
      $risk = $plugin->risk;

  Parse::Nessus::XML::Plugin->new
      my $plugin = Parse::Nessus::XML::Plugin->new( $scan, ID => 10964 );
      my $risk = $plugin->risk;

    Available attributes are: id, name, version, family, cve_id, bugtraq_id,
    category, risk, summary, copyright
